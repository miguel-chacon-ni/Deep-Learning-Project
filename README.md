## Project Description

A cookie distributor, has hired us - team pink - to predict their customers' perceived quality of the products in its portfolio. <br> They have purhcased a cookie dataset and asked the team to develope a Machine Learning model to predict cookies' perceived quality.

## Dataset

We were given a 16 column dataset with cookies characteristics and around 5000 observations. The target variable was the Quality of the cookies.

## Workflow
- Understanding Dataset
- Wrangling Data
- Design Data Preprocessing Pipelines
- Assemble and Optimize ML Models
- Pitch our Model to a Jury


## Organization

-In order to develop our model, we worked as a team to plan our workflow. We then divided activities and collaborated with our code through GitHub, meeting regularly to take decisions on key elements of the pipeline.
Once the preprocessing pipeline was ready, the remaining tasks and model training were divided into each component of the group.
